# homework1
This repository contains my submission for the first homework assigned by the Binary Studio Academy.

Branch "master" contains a text document with an abstract for the article "Big Universe, Big Data: Machine Learning
and Image Analysis for Astronomy", which I have recently read, and a couple of comments on that matter.

Branch "branch2" contains two such text documents, because I was so impressed by that single article that it outshone all the others I could find.
